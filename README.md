## About The Project

We created a Web Scraper for several specific sites.

In order to run the scripts, here's what you need.

Download and install:

* Selenium [pip install selenium]
* Web Driver
* Gecko Driver [sudo pacman -S geckodriver]
* Google Chrome

### Built With

* [Python]
* [Selenium]

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Each of these scripts were writen in Python, using the selenium library. Find the name of the site you want to scrape, and execute it [python tur_colombia.py].

This will run the script and you will see your PC open a Google Chrome Window and start scrapping all of its contents. This process will take between 10 to 15 minutes.

Each execution will generate, or update, a JSON file that has all the information that was scraped from each site.
